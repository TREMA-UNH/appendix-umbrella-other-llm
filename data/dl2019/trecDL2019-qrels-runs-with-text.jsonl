White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.", "paragraph": {}, "paragraph_data": {"judgments": [{"paragraphId": "8273759", "query": "207786", "relevance": "0", "titleQuery": "207786"}], "rankings": [{"method": "bm25base_rm3_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 3, "score": 2.7756}, {"method": "idst_bert_p1", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": 0.9192146882414818}, {"method": "srchvrs_ps_run2", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 7, "score": 1.115444}, {"method": "UNH_exDL_bm25", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 2, "score": 40.545544}, {"method": "srchvrs_ps_run3", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 4, "score": 2.788689}, {"method": "bm25tuned_prf_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 8, "score": 20.159901}, {"method": "idst_bert_pr1", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": 0.9192146882414818}, {"method": "TUW19-p1-f", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 7, "score": -3.4998779296875}, {"method": "UNH_bm25", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 2, "score": 31.535053}, {"method": "bm25tuned_ax_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 9, "score": 19.9517}, {"method": "ICT-CKNRM_B", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 2, "score": -59.322124}, {"method": "p_exp_bert", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 11, "score": -0.009188664}, {"method": "ms_duet_passage", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 4, "score": 66.96810913085938}, {"method": "TUA1-1", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 10, "score": 11.990974627435207}, {"method": "runid4", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 7, "score": 16.7736759185791}, {"method": "runid3", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 7, "score": 16.517227172851562}, {"method": "TUW19-p3-f", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 8, "score": -10.007987260818481}, {"method": "TUW19-p2-re", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": -14.070172309875488}, {"method": "bm25base_ax_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 8, "score": 20.1017}, {"method": "p_exp_rm3_bert", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 11, "score": -0.009188664}, {"method": "bm25base_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 9, "score": 11.0339}, {"method": "test1", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 10, "score": 0.1}, {"method": "ICT-BERT2", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 12, "score": 0.8197368}, {"method": "p_bert", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 11, "score": -0.009188664}, {"method": "TUW19-p2-f", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": -14.070172309875488}, {"method": "bm25tuned_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 11, "score": 11.1612}, {"method": "TUW19-p3-re", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 9, "score": -10.007987260818481}, {"method": "bm25base_prf_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": 21.013901}, {"method": "idst_bert_p3", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": 0.9430775791406631}, {"method": "idst_bert_pr2", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": 0.9430775791406631}, {"method": "TUW19-p1-re", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 7, "score": -3.4998779296875}, {"method": "ICT-CKNRM_B50", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 5, "score": -59.322124}, {"method": "idst_bert_p2", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 6, "score": 0.9192146882414818}, {"method": "bm25tuned_rm3_p", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 10, "score": 2.7055}, {"method": "srchvrs_ps_run1", "paragraphId": "8273759", "queryId": "207786", "rank": 3, "score": 6.629423}]}}, {"paragraph_id": "8273760", "text": "But the advantages of endothermy are costly.
